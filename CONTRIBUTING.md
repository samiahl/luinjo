## So, you want part of the Glory?

There are a number of ways you can contribute to Luinjo project.

1. Report an issue or come up with an enhancement
* Fork the Project, patch it, send a Pull Request
* Spread the word!
* Troll around the IRC channel to make developers feel less lonely

### Issues and Enhancements
Luinjo uses my vision of a functional Project management system, which relies heavily on GitHub provided tools for social coding. I don't know how other people use it, but the Issue tracker to me has some direct mappings to the defined User Stories. I use Milestones to record what I want from the software on a high level. They're also the defining points, when the version number will be bumped up. Labels are used for User Stories to bind related issues under the same feature. They're also used to group tasks in a specific sprint, if that model is adopted at some point of this project.

### Fork it
* Fork it
* Clone it
* Change it
* Push it

Remember to refer to issues in your commit messages. Also, follow T. Pope's solid advice on commit messages; follow my lead or ask, if somethings unclear.

### Spread the word
If you find this piece of software useful, tell about it to your parents and friends. Earn that Karma, or whatever system Luinjo will be using! Internet points!

### IRC
Brainstorming on an IRC channel is a great way to pass time and come up with the next killer features. At the moment this project is mostly 'Social Coding By Myself'. Hopefully, I won't have to be Forever Alone with this.
